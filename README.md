THE PROJECT:
I developed the YouMatter iOS9 app in Swift as a tool to help victims of domestic violence connect to their most accessible and nearby local resources. It can provide users with a list of hotlines that will connect them to counseling, legal help, information about appropriate shelters or short/medium-term housing, and other forms of support that already exist but that are challenging to find and organize by searching the internet. The app will also help women who fear a lack of privacy and intimidation or violence if their abuser tracks their online searches. On every screen, there is a Leave app button which will escape the application immediately without leaving any information on the phone. Many victims have their phones searched by their abusers and need this kind of privacy consideration.

HOW IT WORKS:
The app opens to a opens to an introductory screen (that already has a Leave app button for quick escape from the session). Upon clicking the red “Find Help” button at the bottom of the screen, users will be taken to a map of their current location. The application will be complex eventually, but as of 10-6-15, the functionality is limited to finding the user’s current location and connecting the user to two other screens, depending on what they select. If the user selects “Hotlines,” she will be taken to a list of hotlines, both local and regional. If the user selects “Local Shelters,” she will be connected to a list of shelters that are within 10 miles of her current location.  The functionality to pull down information from the web is partially completed. As stated, the functionality for finding the user’s current location is already more complex than many apps.
